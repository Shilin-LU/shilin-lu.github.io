I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [College of Computing and Data Science](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), [Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), where I have the privilege of being supervised by Dr. Yanzhu Liu and [Prof. Adams Wai-Kin Kong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/AdamsKong/). 

Prior to this, I earned my Master's degree at [School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee), under the guidance of [Dr. Siyuan Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lzLsF2MAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Alex Chichung Kot](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/eackot/index.html). I completed my Bachelor's degree at [Shandong University (SDU)](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm), where I was fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Chengyou Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ESsx9WUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), whose gmeticulous and dedicated guidance laid the foundation for my future research endeavors.

##### **Research Interests**
My interests lie in Generative Models and AI Security. Currently, I am engaged in exploring the potential of large-scale generative models for applications in images, videos, and 3D scenes. Meanwhile, I am committed to addressing the security, privacy, and copyright challenges these models pose, with the aim of enhancing their practical applications while mitigating societal risks.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
